# ML-DL-Learning

Topics of ML-DL to make your Basic and Foundation strong.

## Learning Steps

This repository covers essential topics in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to build a strong foundation. The content is organized into modules, each focusing on key concepts and practical implementations.

### 1. Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
   - **Encoding and Binning**: Techniques for handling categorical data and binning numerical data.
   - **Scaling and Transformation**: Methods to normalize and transform data for better model performance, including standard scaling, log transformations, and more.
   - **Text Processing**: Tools and methods for preprocessing text data in NLP tasks.

### 2. [Future Modules]
   - Add more modules as the repository expands.
   - **Regex Python**: A new module for learning and practicing regular expressions in Python.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
- Navigate to specific topics and run the Python scripts to explore implementations.
- Each subdirectory contains code examples and explanations.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute by adding more topics or improving existing code.
